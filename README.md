## Description
I created this app to help myself learn the streets of Dublin a bit better. The front-end is created with React and Redux, the back-end is a rails app called [StreetSmartBackEnd](https://github.com/wardch/StreetSmartBackEnd)

## Deployment

This toy app is deployed on heroku on a free hobby-server, it may next a few extra seconds to warm up if it hasn't received another request in the last hour: https://street-smart-dublin.herokuapp.com/
